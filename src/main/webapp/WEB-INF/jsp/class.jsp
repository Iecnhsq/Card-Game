        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-hunter.png" class="leftimg"/>
            From an early age the call of the wild draws some 
            adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving 
            primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of 
            their environment, they are able to slip like ghosts through the trees 
            and lay traps in the paths of their enemies.

        <h1 style="color: #68ccef">Mage</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-mage.png" class="leftimg"/>
            Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline 
            may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi 
            is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most 
            devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, 
            magi wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give 
            them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts 
            of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze.

        <h1 style="color: #fff">Priest</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-priest.png" class="leftimg"/>
            Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their 
            unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have 
            left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines 
            so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible 
            conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders.

        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-rogue.png" class="leftimg"/>
            For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is 
            purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries 
            rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they 
            will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the 
            shadows before the victim hits the ground.

        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-shaman.png" class="leftimg"/>
            Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, 
            but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune 
            with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, 
            and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. 
            It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among 
            earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to 
            support the shamanâ€™s allies or punish those who threaten them.

        <p>
            <img src="src/img/icon-warrior.png" class="leftimg"/>
            For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to 
            master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast 
            knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from 
            the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from 
            behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest 
            threat with a variety of deadly weapons.
